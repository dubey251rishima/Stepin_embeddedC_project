Introduction

The vehicle monitoring is one of the major feature of our project.
 In this technology it is used to determine the presence of the passanger and it the passanger exist then our system starts the functionality.
So in nowdays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier.
In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the passangers existance 
and Heat Monitoring and Displaying

Features

Its capable of determining weather the user is exist or not in the vehicle.

• If Passanger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication.

. After the indication it will determine the heat

• Driver and the passanger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.

• The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system

  Modular Based Programming

SWOT Analysis

*1 Strength
  User Friendly
  Easy to alter the Temparature inside the vehicles
  Modular Approach
  Low cost and Robust system
   

Weakness

Its only applicable for those countries which are having sow temperature

Opportunities

It can be implemented by having buth Heater and AC

Threats

• Not suitable for average or high temperature places

4W's and 1'H

WHAT: STEPin Seat Temperature Monitoring System

WHERE: Used in Automotive Industries

WHEN At low Temperature

WHY Health issues

HOW: By Generating Heat
